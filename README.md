The goal is to use a hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder (HRED) architecture to build a dialogue system.

Note: running Python as a daemon in EC2...
```
>screen
>python scriptname.py
```
[Close Session]
[Open New Session]
```
>screen -rD
```
OR
```
nohup python filename.py &
```
Directs output of the file to nohup.out
